# Monkey
The purpose of the project is to automate API Development based on Handler Design Pattern. You might think of Handler Design Pattern as a general purpose function that accept some parameters and returns some objects/records. Thus if:
* You are developing **CQRS** Handlers and want to automatically expose them by conventions with REST API 
* You are developing **T-SQL stored procedures** in database and you want to automatically expose procedures by conventions with REST API
Then you are at right place.
